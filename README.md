# Website-V2

This is the source code for my new personal website. Has all this NPM stuff here because I wanted a live reloading environment for development. The reason for all this being on GitHub is that I simply couldn't be bothered to do this via SFTP and set up CircleCI to SCP the files for me. **#justdeveloperproblems**

Also, the design is from HTML5UP because I suck at making websites look good. See [LICENSE.txt](public/dev/LICENSE.txt).
