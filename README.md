# Website-V2

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/linuswillner/Website-V2.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is the source code for my old personal website. The new version is live now at https://linuswillner.me and the source code can be found in [Website-V3](https://github.com/linuswillner/Website-V3).

I replaced this version with the new one because this site consists of hackjob HTML, CSS and JS spaghetti that I didn't feel like unraveling so I just made a new one. Kthxbye
