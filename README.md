# Website-V2

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/LWTechGaming/Website-V2.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is the source code for my new personal website at https://linuswillner.me.

The reason for all this being on GitHub is that I simply couldn't be bothered to do this via SFTP and set up CircleCI to SCP the files for me. **#justdeveloperproblems**

Uses my [website boilerplate](https://github.com/LWTechGaming/website-boilerplate) for the live reloading system, [Browserify](http://browserify.org) for bundle transpilation and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for Continuous Integration.

Also, the design is from HTML5 UP because I suck at making websites look good. See [LICENSE.txt](public/dev/LICENSE.txt).
