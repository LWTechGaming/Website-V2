                  <span class="image left"><img src="images/loviisa.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>I was born in 1999 in Loviisa, Finland, at a time where Linus Torvalds and his Linux operating system were gaining traction, the Euro was invented and the sixth billionth human was born. Torvalds was not an inspiration for my name, though the correlation has seemed to be an omen as you’ll see later down the line. But I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s get back to the start.</p>
                  <p>As a child, I was always interested in how things work. I would read tons of books explaining on how machines and vehicles worked, and I would often draw pictures of things with a pedantic attention to internal detail. I’ve always been a horrendous artist, but drawing internals of machines was something I very much liked.</p>
                  <span class="image right"><img src="images/vista.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>I grew up with the Windows Vista operating system at home and at school. It was God awful to use and sometimes simply refused to work at all. I was also confused to no end when some web games worked on a Windows XP machine at my dad’s print shop, but not at home. Later I realized it was because of the XP-Vista apartheid of the time, but back then it was simple as “Why does this work here but not there?”.</p>
                  <p>Video games have always been close to my heart. My family used to own a Nintendo 64 which had Super Mario 64 on it, and I would play that always when I could. I never finished the game, and the console was sold, to the dismay of both myself and my family now. We also owned a Wii, and I’d play the motion control games that came with it with my brother for hours on end. It was also sold. Mistakes were truly made when I was young and naïve…</p>
                  <p>When I got into secondary school, I started experimenting with using computers outside of just playing games. The curiosity of how things worked from my early childhood started to kick in, so I started the whole trial-and-error-scheme. I took a brief IT course in secondary school, which was not hugely useful but still paved the way into what I know today. At the time, I wanted to be an English teacher. My English had grown very proficient due to visionary degradation, and due to not having glasses at first, I had to listen to TV shows like Mythbusters since I couldn’t see the subtitles. This mindset carried on into upper secondary school.</p>
                  <p>As time went on, I started learning more and more about computers and solving problems with them. Before I was able to fully comprehend it, it became apparent that I was the go-to person for computer issues in my secondary school class. This, to my amusement, has not changed and I still am that person to this day. Last time I was consulted over such things was on the day I'm writing this, funnily enough.</p>
                  <span class="image left"><img src="images/discord.png" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>In April of 2016, while I was in upper secondary school, an online friend from Google+ (Yes, I used that once upon a time) asked me to help out with a project he was setting up. That project became the, now no longer operational, Minecraft server KarpaloCraft. At this time, a chat program called Discord was making its way to become the next big thing for gamers. Since I had heard of the program, I suggested we’d use that as a community hub.<br/>Soon I learned that you could have bots on the platform, so I looked some up. The bots I ran for KarpaloCraft became my first development project and an introduction to Open Source Software. I tried out WildBeast and a music bot in Python. Me and a friend also translated the bots to Finnish with near to zero programming knowledge (We could barely differentiate a string from an expression), and while it was a colossal crap-fest, we had a ton of fun doing it over a summer.</p>
                  <span class="image right"><img src="images/code3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>This also served as my introduction to programming. WildBeast was written in JavaScript and I started picking up some knowledge of the language. In autumn 2016, the WildBeast developers opened up staff applications, so I decided to have a crack at it. I was picked up, and my first project was to write documentation for the system. So, I did, after which I participated in the development of WildBeast. Today, I am the lead documentation writer and developer for TheSharks (The organisation formed from the WildBeast devs). It’s funny to think that it all started from me translating a computer program, and here I am, actually a part of the team.</p>
                  <p>As I gained experience, I managed to get a foot in the door for slightly more important projects. During winter 2016-2017, I created or contributed to bots for different YouTuber/streamer Discord servers, a demographic that was discovering the platform and was in need of automation of moderation tasks. I worked for content creators like Muselk, Overwatch Central and Max Box, creating Discord bots for them.</p>
                  <span class="image left"><img src="images/paths.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>When these experiences were racking up, I started to feel a need for doing something else than being an English teacher in the future. Programming was so interesting that I eventually just accepted the reality: I hadn’t wanted to be a teacher all along; programming was my thing to do. Due to being midway through upper secondary school, I also predicted university would be locked out for me as my studies were laid out as humanistic instead of logic-mathematical. But polytechnic would be an option, I thought. I'd make it one way or another, and I'd be a software developer one day, I thought.</p>
                  <p>During spring-autumn 2017, I developed two public Discord bots of my own with my internet friend Curtis from the US. Christened Logger and Swordfish, both saw minor use but were important in getting me to be properly proficient at JavaScript and common programming paradigms. However, after the summer, I felt like I had hit the skill ceiling when it came to Discord and wanted to do something new.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, during the summer, I had been working at my father’s print shop as a systems administrator and technician of sorts, restructuring the network and performing lots of infrastructure upgrades. Towards the end of the summer, I was given a program from the early 2000s that hadn’t been updated since and a task to re-create it for modern systems. This has been my introduction to front-end and API-driven development contrary to the traditional command-line programs I had been writing for a long time.</p>
                  <span class="image left"><img src="images/me2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>And here I am sitting today, in front of a computer screen, drinking coffee from my GitHub mug and writing my story. What lies ahead, then? As for education, polytechnic and ICT engineer degree in programming is what I’m going for now. When it comes to programming, I’m looking to learn a new programming language next spring when my matriculation exams are over and I have time to spare. I’ve thought of learning Java and perhaps cramming in Python there too. Paid programming work is something I do already and I’m looking to expand in that field currently.</p>
                  <p>However, in the words of famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius: “I’m a composer, not a fortune teller”. Who knows what lies ahead; I certainly don’t. Looking back, I’ve already gotten quite far while only just having turned 18. I know for a fact there’s still a lot to see and do. Life is finite, but the opportunities aren’t, am I right?</p>
                  <br/><br/>
